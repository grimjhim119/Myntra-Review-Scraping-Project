The extracted data can later\n","be used for sentiment analysis, rating analysis, and decision-making support.\n","\n","Due to dynamic JavaScript rendering and scraping restrictions on Myntra’s website,\n","this project demonstrates the scraping logic using saved HTML content that matches\n","the real Myntra review structure. This approach is commonly used for academic\n","and learning purposes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Objective of the Project\n","The main objectives of this project are:\n","- To understand web scraping concepts using Python\n","- To extract customer review text and ratings\n","- To store scraped data in a structured tabular format\n","- To prepare review data for further analysis such as sentiment analysis\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Technologies Used\n","- Python\n","- Google Colab\n","- BeautifulSoup\n","- Pandas\n","- Web Scraping\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Dataset Description\n","The dataset created in this project consists of:\n","- **Review**: Customer feedback text\n","- **Rating**: Star rating given by the customer (1 to 5)\n","\n","The extracted data is stored in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Steps Involved in the Project\n","\n","### Step 1: HTML Content Preparation\n","Sample Myntra review HTML content is used to simulate real product review data.\n","This helps in demonstrating the scraping logic without violating website restrictions.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 2: HTML Parsing\n","BeautifulSoup is used to parse the HTML content and locate review blocks\n","based on their HTML tags and class names.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 3: Data Extraction\n","Customer reviews and ratings are extracted from the parsed HTML and stored\n","in Python lists.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Step 4: Data Storage\n","The extracted reviews and ratings are converted into a Pandas DataFrame\n","and saved as a CSV file for future use.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Result\n","The project successfully extracts customer reviews and ratings and stores them\n","in a structured dataset. The resulting CSV file can be used for data analysis\n","and visualization tasks.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","This project demonstrates how web scraping can be used to collect customer\n","feedback from e-commerce platforms. Even though direct scraping from Myntra\n","is restricted, the implemented approach effectively explains the scraping process.\n","\n","The project serves as a strong foundation for advanced tasks such as:\n","- Sentiment analysis\n","- Customer feedback analysis\n","- Product recommendation systems\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Future Scope\n","- Perform sentiment analysis on scraped reviews\n","- Visualize rating distributions\n","- Automate review collection for multiple products\n","- Deploy analysis results using a web application\n"],"metadata":{"id":"sbzb_l4yktd_"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":275},"id":"sbg96-YJkVM1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1768361730247,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1070,"user":{"displayName":"Rimjhim Gupta","userId":"17442860503033909961"}},"outputId":"ee98a5d9-17b3-4b4a-f138-855b61480beb"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["✅ Myntra Reviews Scraped Successfully\n","📁 File saved as: myntra_reviews.csv\n","\n","📊 Extracted Reviews:\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                       Review Rating\n","0         Amazing quality and perfect fitting      5\n","1          Good product but delivery was late      4\n","2                    Average material quality      3\n","3                   Poor stitching and fabric      2\n","4  Excellent product, totally worth the price      5"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-c0a72831-214b-422e-a8f6-d813c73e952f\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Review</th>\n","      <th>Rating</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Amazing quality and perfect fitting</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>Good product but delivery was late</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Average material quality</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Poor stitching and fabric</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Excellent product, totally worth the price</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-c0a72831-214b-422e-a8f6-d813c73e952f')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-c0a72831-214b-422e-a8f6-d813c73e952f button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
